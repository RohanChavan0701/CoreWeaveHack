"""The seed: the smallest configuration that runs one full cycle.

The loop's first organs cannot have been admitted by the loop and need not
be. Genesis writes the registry (Appendix C of the specification), the
constitution under its cap (Appendix A.1), the genesis work-shape terms
(A.2), the boot and close lens fans (A.3), and the id counters. Everything
else is minted by the loop from its own miss stream, through the ladder, at
the bars. Genesis articles and terms carry ``warrant.evidence: genesis`` and
earn an anchor by the third consolidation pass or are evicted.

``store/registry/*.json`` and ``store/constitution/*.json`` in the repository
are this module's output at genesis; afterwards they are registers the loop
corrects in place, and git carries the divergence.
