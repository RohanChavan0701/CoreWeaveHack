"""Projections: regenerated read models under ``<store>/index/``, never hand-edited.

Each projection is a pure function of the store, listed in :data:`PROJECTIONS`.
``regenerate`` writes them all; ``check`` reports which committed projections
differ from regeneration (the projection-coherence gate of the lint).

Every cell obeys the settlement test (spec § 8.2): it carries what a reader
cannot comply with without opening the record — ids, hook prose, exclusions,
stakes, owed acts — and never a compliable sentence. The decision sentence
itself is evicted to the full record; :data:`FORBIDDEN_CELL_KEYS` names the
fields the lint refuses in any cell.

One file under ``index/`` is not a projection: ``controls.json``, the blind
coder's seeded-control telemetry, written by ``hgi lens-battery``
(:mod:`hgi.lens_battery`) the way the lens register's telemetry is, and left
alone by regeneration.
