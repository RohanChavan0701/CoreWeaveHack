"""§ 9.5 — the machine-native answerer: the blind second coder and the guard evaluator.

Two roles that want a deterministic, non-narrative answer, kept out of the
context that would otherwise decide for itself:

- ``cluster`` groups raw anchored observations by the convention each turned
  on — the backward pass's grouping axis — proposing clusters over the raw
  ``happened`` rather than picking from a closed enum, *without seeing* the
  consolidator's candidate labels;
- ``code`` classifies raw anchored observations against a registry vocabulary
  (the escape reviews, the lens battery) *without seeing* any candidate label;
- ``guard`` returns a hook's guard result for a work-shape classification,
  so the context that will apply the payload does not decide whether it fires.

The vendor is a coordinate: TypeSafe AI's System1 is used when
``$TYPESAFE_BASE_URL``, ``$TYPESAFE_API_KEY`` and ``$TYPESAFE_MODEL_ID`` are
set (an OpenAI-compatible surface is assumed); otherwise the fallback is a
second, separately prompted frozen-model context with the labels withheld —
the ``coder`` role of :mod:`hgi.model`.
