"""The sketch: what a drafting role judges, and the record body derived from it.

A decision record's body is mostly mechanism — latch objects, owed acts,
lifecycles, a retirement guard copied from the bars — and only partly
judgment: the payload, its named overshoot, the cue and its exclusions, the
premises as falsifiers, the watch, the residue. A model asked for the whole
body fills the mechanism with placeholders and the judgment thins out. So
the drafting roles (the consolidator at nomination, the pass at close)
return a :class:`Sketch` — the five slots as judgment, nothing derivable —
and :func:`body` derives the :class:`hgi.types.DecisionBody` from it under
the store's bars. The stub answers in the same shape. The floor still runs
over the derived body; the examiner and adjudicator still read the full
draft. A sketch is not a record: it has no envelope and is never stored.
