"""The role prompts, one file each, each priced; and the request contract.

A prompt file is Markdown with a leading ``priced_for:`` line naming the
models its replies have been read against, comma-separated (``stub`` is
the deterministic stand-in). ``prompt(role)`` returns the body; the four
contexts of the backward pass share no prompt text beyond the store's
schemas, which every role receives through :func:`schemas`. The lint warns
when a role runs on a model its prompt is not priced for (``hgi roles
pricing`` lists them); a model earns its place on the line when every
request the role answers has been read back through ``hgi roles try``.

Every request a role receives is one JSON object built by :func:`request`:
its ``request`` field names the request, its ``reply`` field states the
exact shape of the answer (:data:`REPLIES`, one entry per request), and the
rest is the request's content. The reply shape travels with the request
rather than living in the prompt, so a model that has never seen the code
answers in the shape the code reads, and the stub — which answers by the
``request`` field — is the same contract by example.
