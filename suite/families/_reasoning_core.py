"""Reasoning Core's checkers and generators, vendored for the ``reasoning-core`` family.

The generators come from Reasoning Core (``sileod/reasoning-core``, MIT); this
module holds two things and nothing that imports the suite:

- the **checks**, at runtime — a produced string is graded by the generator's
  own verdict, not by a comparison against a stored answer. ``regex_ok`` is
  Reasoning Core's regex-following verdict (``regex.py``): a non-empty visible
  ASCII string that ``regex.fullmatch`` accepts. ``cfg_ok`` is grammar
  membership by the same parser Reasoning Core's grammar tasks use, NLTK's
  Earley chart parser (``grammar.py``). Both import only ``regex`` and
  ``nltk`` — declared in ``pyproject`` — never ``reasoning_core``;
- the **generation**, at fetch time — :func:`records` drives Reasoning Core's
  ``RegexFollowing`` and grammar generators at a pinned difficulty level and
  returns the pinned instances. It imports ``reasoning_core`` and its
  generation stack (``gramforge``, ``faker``, …) lazily, so a run that only
  reads the pinned file never needs them.

Reasoning Core's difficulty is a single integer ``level`` its configs fold
into their own fields (``RegexConfig``: pattern depth and example count;
``GrammarConfig``: rule count, sentence depth, alphabet). Generation is made
reproducible against that revision: ``gramforge.generate`` reseeds Python's
RNG from entropy on every call (``seed=None``), so :func:`records` patches the
name Reasoning Core bound and feeds it seeds from a per-instance
``random.Random``; ``faker`` is seeded before the task modules are imported,
since their terminal word lists are built at import.
