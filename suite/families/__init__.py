"""Task families: each a source of :class:`suite.tasks.Task` under one name.

A family is hand-written (``genesis``, ``conventions``) or transcribed from
a public dataset into a pinned file under ``suite/data/`` (``mbpp``, …). A
transcribed family declares ``fetch``, the transcriber from the dataset's
rows to the pinned records, which ``hgi suite fetch <family>`` runs once;
its ``tasks`` then reads the pinned file, so a run needs no network and the
suite hash is stable. A family may also be *derived* — no ``fetch`` of its
own, its ``tasks`` reading another family's pinned records and presenting
them differently (``api`` over ``tables``). The registry is
:data:`FAMILIES`; a family registers itself by importing here.
