"""The reasoning-core family: Reasoning Core's procedural generators as produce-and-verify tasks.

Each task states a small formal-language problem and is graded by the
generator's own checker rather than by a comparison against a stored answer.
Two generators are carried, both of which make the agent churn shell calls to
verify a candidate before it answers:

- **regex-following** — produce a non-empty visible-ASCII string that a given
  regular expression fully matches; the hidden check is Reasoning Core's
  ``regex.fullmatch`` verdict;
- **cfg-generation** — produce a string of at least ``min_tokens`` terminals
  that a given context-free grammar derives; the hidden check is grammar
  membership under the Earley chart parser Reasoning Core's grammar tasks use.

Each difficulty tier is pinned into its own file — the moderate tier into
``suite/data/reasoning-core.jsonl``, the harder tier into
``suite/data/reasoning-core-hard.jsonl`` — at that tier's per-generator level
(Reasoning Core's integer ``level`` knob) and a stored seed each, so a run
needs neither the network nor the generation stack and the suite hash is
stable. The tier is a config value (:class:`suite.families._reasoning_core.Tier`),
so a harder tier is a data change, not a fork of the generation code. The
pinned record carries the presentation and the checker's inputs — the regex, or
the grammar and its start symbol and length floor — never a witness, so the
file cannot leak an answer. :mod:`suite.families._reasoning_core` holds the
checkers, the tiers and the seeded generator, and the ``source`` string pins
the revision and license.

Four families are built, a lax/strict pair per tier, differing only in slack,
as ``curriculum`` and ``curriculum-strict`` do. Within a tier the lax family
(``reasoning-core``, ``reasoning-core-hard``) budgets each task at the knowing
policy's one verification call plus one, so a pass may spend a call iterating on
a candidate; the strict family (``reasoning-core-strict``,
``reasoning-core-hard-strict``) budgets at exactly that one call, so a wrong
first candidate cannot be repaired within budget. The ``-hard`` pair draws from
the harder tier: deeper-nested patterns and larger grammars with longer members,
generated on seed bases disjoint from the moderate tier so the two tiers share
no instance. The strict twin of a tier shares that tier's instances. All
instances are disjoint from every other family's — a regex or a grammar, under
ids no other family uses.

The hidden check grades the answer alone — the produced witness under
``regex.fullmatch``, the grammar member under NLTK membership — and never fails
a row for spending its budget. The budget is a real tool-call limit: the tool
layer refuses a call past the pool's limit and the economy series measures
adherence (``tool_budget_respected``), but a refused call fails no task. The
pools separate through the answer, not a budget flag. The strict pool (zero
slack) grants one verification call, so an actor whose first candidate is wrong
cannot repair it within budget and answers with the losing candidate — a method
failure the answer check catches; the lax pool's one spare call lets a wrong
first candidate be repaired before the answer is graded. On the harder tier,
where a first candidate is often wrong, that is what makes the strict pool bite.
Grading the budget itself confounds this — it fails an actor that verifies a
correct answer but over-spends, so the teacher learns budget arithmetic instead
of the produce-and-verify method (carry-forward items 47, 56).
